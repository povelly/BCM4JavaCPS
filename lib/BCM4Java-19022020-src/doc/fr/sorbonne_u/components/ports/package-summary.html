Ports are the entities that allow components to expose services and call other
components' services.  The basic properties of ports are defined by the
interface <code>PortI</code> and implemented by the abstract class
<code>AbstractPort</code>.  As such, components offer services as offered
interfaces (interfaces extending <code>OfferedI</code>) and allow other
components to call these services through inbound ports, that are defined
by the interface <code>InboundPortI</code> and implemented by the class
<code>AbstractInboundPort</code>.  Symmetrically, components can require other
components services as required interfaces  (interfaces extending
<code>RequiredI</code>) and call them through outbound ports, that are defined
by the interface <code>OutboundPortI</code> and implemented by the class
<code>AbstractOutboundPort</code>.  Inbound and outbound ports are connected
through connectors (subclasses of <code>AbstractConnector</code>).
<p>

<p>
An outbound port is an object that typically implements (in the Java sense) the
required interface to allow the internal code of the client component to call
its required methods on that port.  The port then calls the connector, which
therefore also implements the required interface.  The connector then calls
the inbound port of the server component, which implements the offered interface.
The inbound port is thus responsible for calling the actual service on the
server component.  From the implementation point of view, if the server
component is sequential, the inbound port can call the service method using
plain Java method calls.  If the server component is concurrent, then the
inbound port will create a service runnable task that will be submitted to
the thread pool of the server component for execution.  Hence, when the server
component is sequential (or passive), the service is executed by the thread of
the client component (or the thread that is executing the code in the client
component that made the call).  But when the server component is concurrent
(or active), the thread of the client executes everything until the inbound
port, and then a thread of the server component executes the service.  However,
when programming the port, there is no need to make a difference as the call
to the owner component should always use the <code>handleRequest</code>
methods which are properlu defined to use a thread or not depending on the
owner to be passive or active.
</p>

<p>
Ports play a key role in making the components callable even among different
JVM and hosts.  Ports therefore have a URI so that they can be published on
registry.  When deploying an application within a single JVM, only a local
registry and plain Java method calls are used.  When the application is deployed
on multiple JVM and hosts, calls among the JVM are using RMI.  In RMI, only
the called methods must be published in the RMI registry.  Hence, outbound
ports need just to be published in the local registry (so that the connection
logic in the class <code>ConnectionBuilder</code> can know them), but inbound
ports that are meant to be called across JVM must be published on the RMI
registry.  The abstract classes <code>AbstractAssembly</code> and
<code>AbstractDistributedAssembly</code> provide respectively the methods for
publishing ports locally or in the RMI registry.  Using RMI is manisfested by
the fact that the interface <code>OfferedI<code> extends the interface
<code>java.rmi.Remote</code> and by the fact that the class
<code>AbstractInboundPort</code> extends the class
<code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>.
</p>

<p>
For data exchange interfaces, <code>DataOfferedI</code> and
<code>DataRequiredI</code>, the exchanges are made through method calls both
in pull and push modes.  In pull mode, the calls originate from the client
component and works as in the client/server case using the pull interface of
<code>DataRequiredI</code> and then <code>DataOfferedI</code>.  In push mode,
components exchange roles.  The server component, which produces the data,
pushes it to the client using the push interface of <code>DataOfferedI</code>
and then <code>DataRequiredI</code>.  Pull and push interfaces therefore
install two symmetric flow of call: a standard one where the client component
calls the server component to get data, and another one where the server
initiates the calls and therefore plays the role of a client and the client
plays the role of the server.  Note that the data itself is defined as
implementing the interface <code>DataOfferedI.DataI</code> on the server
side and the interface <code>DataRequiredI.DataI</code> on the client
side.  The connector is therefore responsible for implementing conversion
methods <code>required2offered</code> and <code>offered2required</code>
to transform the data from one representation to the other.
</p>

<p>
Hence, data inbound ports, defined by the interface <code>DataInboundPortI</code>
and implemented by <code>AbstractDataInboundPort</code>, implement the data
offered pull interface and passes the calls on this interface to the server
component as previously described.  But they also implement the data offered
push interface that the server component will call to push the data.
Symmetrically, data outbound ports, defined by the interface
<code>DataOutboundPortI</code> and implemented by
<code>AbstractDataOutboundPort</code>, implement the data
required pull interface that client components will call to request data.  But
they also implement the data required push interface that will be called through
the connector and passes the calls on this interface to the client component as
previously described for the inbound ports.  Note that when components are
in different JVM, the calls must be made through RMI, as in the client/server
case.  However, as the calls can go from the client to the server and from the
server to the client, the data inbound ports must be published in the RMI
registry for their pull interfaces, and the data outbound port must be published
for their push interfaces.
</p>

<p>
Components that call each others services defined in interfaces extending
<code>TwoWayI</code> in a peer-to-peer way uses two way ports defined by the
interface <code>TwoWayPortI</code> and implemented by the class
<code>AbstractTwoWayPort</code>.  These ports are symmetric also, as they can
be used by component A to call the services of component B, but also by the
component B to call services of the component A.  Such peer-to-peer exchanges
can limit to data exchanges, defined by the interface <code>DataTwoWayI</code>
which defines pull and push interfaces.  Hence, ports defined by
<code>DataTwoWayPortI</code> and implemented by
<code>AbstractDataTwoWayPort</code> install a connection that is similar to the
data inbound and outbound ports.  Data two way connectors must also implement
conversion methods for the data, <code>first2second</code> and
<code>second2first</code>.  In both cases, the two way ports must be published
on the RMI registry if the components are executing on different JVM.
</p>

<p>Usage</p>

<p>
Ports for the different kinds of interfaces are created by defining subclasses
of the abstract port classes.  For client/server and two way exchanges, service
signatures are completely user-defined, so the ports (and connectors) methods
are also user-defined.  For data exchanges, pull and push interfaces already
define standard methods which have concrete implementation in the abstract
classes, except when the calls must be passed to the called component, because
the components are free to implement the required methods the way the want.
