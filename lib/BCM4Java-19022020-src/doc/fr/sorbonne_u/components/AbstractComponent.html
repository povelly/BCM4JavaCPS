<div class="block">The class <code>AbstractComponent</code> represents the basic information
 and methods for components in the component model, completing the component
 virtual machine with operations dealing with individual components.

 <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 
 <p>
 In BCM, a component is an instance of class that extends
 <code>AbstractComponent</code> and which implements component services
 with traditional Java methods. <code>AbstractComponent</code> provides
 methods to query components to know its implemented interfaces, the URIs
 of the ports through which one can connect to it and other information.
 All calls to component services pass through inbound ports.  Inbound ports
 as objects implements the methods from an offered component service
 interface but each inbound port method implementation must relay the call
 to a method actually implementing the corresponding service in the component
 object. To relay the call, inbound ports create a component task
 implementing <code>ComponentService</code> and then call the method
 <code>handleRequest</code> passing it this task as parameter.
 </p>
 <p>
 Components can be passive or active. Passive components do not have their
 own thread, so any call they serve will use the thread of the caller. 
 <code>handleRequest</code> simply calls the component service in the
 thread of the caller component. Active components use their own threads
 to perform the tasks.which are managed through the Java Executor framework
 that implements the concurrent servicing of requests.  At creation time,
 components may be given 0, 1 or more threads as well as 0, 1 or more
 schedulable threads. Schedulable threads are useful when some service
 or task must be executed at some specific (real) time or after some
 specific (real) duration.
 </p>
 <p>
 Note that methods that implement the component services need not have the
 same signature as the ones exposed in offered interfaces.  Being able to
 distinguish between exposed and implementation signatures can be interesting
 when a component offers the same interface through several ports.  It can
 then have different implementations of the service depending on the port
 through which it is called.
 </p>
 <p>
 Active, or concurrent, components have their own threads, hence concurrent
 execution can be used to service requests coming from client components or
 to execute some task required by the component itself or by some other
 component.The Java executor service uses Java futures making all calls
 asynchronous call with futures. As BCM aims to provide distributed processing
 capabilities on more than one JVM, Java futures cannot be returned to the
 caller component. Currently, three variations of the method
 <code>handleRequest</code> are proposed to programmers of inbound ports.
 The current <code>handleRequest</code> implementation returns the Java
 future and leave to the inbound port programmer to decide how to use it.
 <code>handleRequestSync</code> forces a synchronous call by getting the
 value of the future right after passing the call to the Java executor.
 <code>handleRequestAsync</code> assumes that no result is expected by the
 caller (typically the method result is <code>void</code>) and makes the
 call asynchronous by returning to the caller immediately after submitting
 the component service task to the Java executor, hence allowing the caller
 resume its execution in parallel with the execution of the component service.
 A fully distributed BCM future variable implementation is planned to be
 added soon, and then the return type of <code>handleRequest</code> will
 be changed to some <code>BCMFuture</code> like class.
 </p>
 <p>
 Active components can also execute pure tasks, implementing
 <code>ComponentTask</code>, in a fire-and-forget mode by calling the
 methods <code>runTask</code> or <code>scheduleTask</code>. Finally,
 in the component life-cycle, the method <code>execute</code> is
 called after the method <code>start</code>. Programmers of components
 can use this method to implement a background processing in the
 component, pretty much as the main method is used in Java classes.
 </p>
 <p>
 To get reliable behaviours, components should execute all code within
 component services and tasks run through the executor service.
 </p>
 <p>
 As it relies on the Executor framework, the concurrent component implements
 part of the <code>ExecutorService</code> interface regarding the life
 cycle management that is simply forwarded to the executor.  Subclasses
 should redefine these methods especially when they implement composite
 components with concurrent subcomponents.
 </p>
 <pre>
 TODO: Still needs more work and thinking about the life cycle implementation
       and in particular the shutting down of components and the interaction
       with reflective features.
 </pre>
 
 <p><i>Usage</i></p>
 
 <p>
 This class is meant to be extended by any class implementing a kind of
 components in the application.  Constructors and methods should be used only
 in the code of the component so to hide technicalities of the implementation
 from the component users.  The proper vision of the component model is to
 consider the code in this package, and therefore in this class, as a virtual
 machine to implement components rather that application code.
 </p>
 <p>
 Components are indeed implemented as objects but calling from the outside of
 these objects methods they define directly is something that should be done
 only in virtual machine code and in this component code but never in other
 components code (i.e., essentially in classes derived from AbstractCVM or in
 the class defining the component or one of its subclasses). The call should
 also use only methods defined within this abstract class and not methods
 defined as services in user components that must be called through the
 Executor framework.
 </p>
 
 <p><i>Executor services management</i></p>
 
 <p>
 Components can have their own threads, which are managed through Java
 executor services. By default, <code>AbstractComponent</code> can
 create two executor services: one for non schedulable threads and
 another for schedulable ones. The constructor takes three arguments,
 the two last ones controlling the number of threads in the non
 schedulable and the schedulable executor services respectively.
 When an inbound port wants to make a service execute on its owner
 component, it constructs a request or a task from
 <code>AbstractService</code> (for requests) or from
 <code>AbstractTask</code> and summit it to the appropriate
 executor service using the methods <code>runTask</code> or
 <code>handleRequest</code> for non scheduled ones and
 <code>scheduleTask</code> or <code>scheduleRequest</code>
 for scheduled ones.
 </p>
 <p>
 Besides the possibility to submit task and requests to these
 two standard executor services, components can also create more
 non schedulable or schedulable executor services giving them
 unique identifiers (URI) using the method
 <code>createNewExecutorService</code>. A complementary set of
 methods for running tasks and executing requests take as first
 argument either the URI of the executor service that must
 execute them. To make these calls more efficient, other
 similar methods take the index of the executor service in
 a vector of executor services defined by the component
 (one can get the index corresponding to a given URI with the
 method <code>getExecutorServiceIndex(java.lang.String)</code>).
 This capability is particularly interesting for components
 that want to separate completely the threads used to execute
 non overlapping subsets of their services or requests, to
 impose a finer concurrency control mechanism or different
 priorities for clients, for example.
 </p>
 
 <p><i>Plug-in facility</i></p>
 
 <p>
 To ease the reuse of component behaviours, BCM implements a plug-in
 facility for components. A plug-in is an object which class inherit from
 <code>AbstractPlugin</code> (see its documentation) and which is meant to
 implement a coherent reusable behaviour consisting of service
 implementations with their required or offered interfaces declarations,
 port creations, as well as a proper plug-in life-cycle with its installation
 on the component, initialisation, finalisation and uninstallation. Plug-ins
 can be added or removed dynamically to and from components; they are
 identified by URI. When an inbound port want to call a service implemented
 by a plug-in, it can retrieve the plug-in from its URI with the method
 <code>getPlugin</code> and then call the service method on the retrieved
 object. To ease this process, a specific set of inbound ports for plug-ins
 can be used; they are created by passing them the URI of their corresponding
 plug-in to abstract the retrieving of the plug-in object away from the user
 code.
 </p>
 
 <p><i>Logging and tracing facility</i></p>
 
 <p>
 Debugging threaded Java code is notoriously difficult as debuggers rarely
 handle thread interruptions correctly. It is even more difficult for
 programs distributed among several JVM. Hence, most of the debugging rely
 on trace or log messages allowing to understand the order of events among
 the different threads and JVM. However, using standard output and standard
 error stream for that is inappropriate when the code is executed on remote
 computers that do not have access to a proper standard output and standard
 error.
 </p>
 <p>
 In place, BCM proposes a logging and tracing facility that can be used even
 in a distributed environment. The basic method to be used to produce trace
 and log messages is <code>logMessage</code>. Each message is tagged with
 the system time at their production. Log and trace can be activated
 independently using the corresponding toggle methods. If none are activated,
 <code>logMessage</code> does nothing. When tracing is activated, each message
 will appear in a trace window. When logging is activated, messages are kept
 until the end of the execution and can be written to a file. The produced
 file is in CSV format, so they can be merged into one file, read as a
 spreadsheet file with time stamps in the first column. Hence, sorting by the
 first column put the messages in their order of execution (modulo the clock
 drifts for distributed programs).
 </p>
 
 <p><i>BCM internal traces</i></p>
 
 <p>
 The component virtual machine defined by <code>AbstractCVM</code> uses the
 logging and tracing facility and complete it with a way to activate,
 deactivate and extend debugging modes that can be tested in if statements
 to activate and deactivate debugging traces. This capability is used in the
 BCM kernel to help the debugging. See the documentation of
 <code>AbstractCVM</code>, <code>CVMDebugModesI</code> and
 <code>CVMDebugModes</code> for more information.

 Due to the use of reflection to find the appropriate constructor in the

 rules that the Java compiler would apply. The actual parameters types

 problem that Java software using reflection face when looking up
 constructors and methods. This forces to avoid sophisticated overriding
 of constructors in component classes and in their call sequences. When
 several constructors can apply, the first to be found is used rather
 than the most specific in compiled Java.
 </p>
 <p>
 If the <code>NoSuchMethodException</code> is thrown, it is likely that
 the match between the actual parameters types and the formal parameters
 ones has not been found by the current algorithm. Programmers must the
 try to change the types of the formal parameters to simplify the
 constructor selection.

 Uniform API entry to execute a call on the component.  The call, that
 represents a method call on the object representing the component, is
 embedded in a <code>ComponentService</code> object.  In concurrent
 components, the Java executor framework is used to handle such requests.
 Sequential components may simply use this method to handle requests, or
 they may bypass it by directly calling the method on the object
 representing the component for the sought of efficiency.
