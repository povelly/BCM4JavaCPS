The package <code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.cvm</code> defines the concept of
component virtual machines (CVM) in the component model.  CVM deploy and run
applications, themselves seen as interconnection of components.  Currently,
two different kinds of CVM are proposed:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Local CVM are meant to deploy simple component-based applications running
  within a single Java virtual machine.</li>
<li>Distributed CVM (or DCVM) are meant to deploy component-based applications,
  over a set of different Java virtual machines called sites of the DCVM, which
  are possibly running on a set of distant hosts.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The major difference between the two kinds of CVM is the fact that DCVM use Java
RMI to interconnect distant components and have to use external registries to
publish the component ports, while in local CVM a simple local registry and only
Java references are used to interconnect components, so that everything runs
within a single JVM.  DCVM also use XML configuration files to make all of their
sites aware of each others and of the overall deployment of the application:
components which run on a set of JVM, which in turn execute on a set of hosts.
Each site of a DCVM also keeps track of its locally deployed components and also
provides the methods to publish and unpublish ports on registries.
</p>
<p>
Application can be deployed statically, or partly statically and partly
dynamically.  In a fully statically deployed application, all of the components
are created and interconnected at once, when the CVM is starting.  In a partly
dynamically deployed application, only a share of the components are statically
created and interconnected, others are created and interconnected during the
execution of the application.  Tools for the dynamic component creation and
connection are described in the package
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.cvm.pre.dcc</code>. Note that at least some
components must be statically deployed and started if an application ever want
to reach execution and be able to dynamically create and connect new components.
The extreme case would be an application that would create only one static
component responsible for the direct or indirect creation and connection of
every other components.
</p>
<p>
Local CVM have essentially two methods helping in the static part of application
deployment.  The <code>deploy</code> method statically instantiates components
and performs the static interconnections among them through their ports using
connectors.  The <code>start</code> method is the entry point to launch the
application, a kind of <code>main</code> method for component-based applications.
It usually performs some initialisations and then calls the start methods of
every statically deployed components (done by the base definition of the method
in the <code>AbstractCVM</code> implementation).
</p>
<p>
DCVM further decompose the <code>deploy</code> method in three phases:
</p>
<ol>
<li>the method <code>initialise</code> that sets up everything that is needed
  locally, and the standard RMI registry reference;</li>
<li>the method <code>instantiateAndPublish</code> that statically creates the
  components that are local to the current part of the virtual machine and the
  publication of their ports on the RMI registry; and,</li>
<li>the method <code>interconnect</code> that statically interconnects the
  static components that need to, relying on the availability of all of their
  required ports on the registry before its execution.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This decomposition enforces (in <code>AbstractDistributedCVM</code>
implementation of <code>deploy</code>) an explicit distributed synchronisation
between the three phases executed on the different sites.  Indeed, to
interconnect components, clients must find in the registry the information about
the ports of the provider components.  The three phases protocol enforces that
and avoids deadlocks that could occur if the publications and interconnections
were badly intertwined.  So, a distributed application is launched by executing
a site of the DCVM within each of the Java virtual machines on which it must
deploy.  One virtual machine per host deploys this host RMI registry, others
just connect to it.  Each site of the DCVM has access to the XML configuration
file giving all of the identifiers of the hosts used for the deployment and
creates only the components that must be deployed on the current site.
