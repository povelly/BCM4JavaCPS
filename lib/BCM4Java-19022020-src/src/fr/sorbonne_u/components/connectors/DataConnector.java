/**
 * The class <code>DataConnector</code> partially implements a basic data
 * connector where components call each others using plain Java method calls
 * only.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * As there are two possible mode for transmitting data, push and pull, the
 * connector establishes a two way connection between the two components,
 * implementing the offering <code>PushI</code> interface with methods calling
 * the requiring <code>PushI</code> and implementing the requiring
 * <code>PullI</code> interface with methods calling the offering
 * <code>PullI</code> one.
 * 
 * The basic sequential data connector simply implements the offered push
 * interface <code>send</code> signature by a method calling the corresponding
 * required push interface signature <code>receive</code> that is then
 * implemented by the requiring component.  Conversely, this connector also
 * implements the required pull interface <code>request</code> signature by a
 * method that merely calls the corresponding offered pull interface
 * <code>get</code> signature then implemented by the offering component.  In
 * both cases, the translating method <code>from</code> is called to translate
 * the offered data type to the required one.
 * 
 * To complete this class, a subclass has only to implement the
 * <code>setConnectorOnComponents</code> method that is required when connecting
 * the two components to allow them to register the connector when needed.  In
 * the case of the basic sequential data connector, both components need to
 * register it to call it in both the push and pull modes.
