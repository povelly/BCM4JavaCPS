/**
 * The interface <code>ConnectorI</code> is the generic interface for
 * connectors that mediate between requiring and offering components.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * Connectors are objects that are used to connect components through their
 * required, offered and two-way interfaces.  A connector first serves as a
 * translator from calls using the required interface to the ones provided by
 * the offered interface.  It therefore implements a required interface by
 * calling the corresponding methods in the offered interface.  For two-way
 * interfaces, connectors have to forward correctly the calls among the peers.
 * 
 * Basically, a connector connects a requiring component to an offering one
 * by implementing the requiring interface with methods that call the
 * offering component through its corresponding offered interface.  A connector
 * therefore implements a mapping between the required and the offered
 * interfaces.  There is no limit to the number of required and offered
 * interfaces that a component may use or implement.
