/**
 * The interface <code>InboundPortI</code> represents the category of
 * <code>PortI</code> that cater for incoming calls from client components
 * towards the service providers.
 * 
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * An inbound port is a component port through which a provider component
 * is called to deliver its services.  It is therefore associated with an
 * offered interface that represents the services that are provided by the
 * component  but that it also implements so that its owner component is
 * called only through the inbound ports.
