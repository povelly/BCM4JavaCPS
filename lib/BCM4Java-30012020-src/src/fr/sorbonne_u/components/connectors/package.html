Connectors are used to make the bridge between two ports exposed by two
components.  Basically, a connector is linked to the two ports and relay
the calls from the one to the other.  Different types of connectors are
proposed to match the different kinds of interfaces.
</p>
<p>
The most generic connector, which basic behaviours are declared in
<code>ConnectorI</code> and defined in <code>AbstractConnector</code>, connects
a client component CC exposing a required
interface R on a outbound port OP (calls go out of the component through this
port) to a server component SC exposing an offered interface O on an inbound
port IP.  As such, the connector is assumed to implement the required interface
R (to receive calls from the client) and to call the server component on its
offered interface O.  The interfaces being user-defined, a connector class
must be implemented to do so.  The class <code>AbstractConnector</code>
provides for the connection logic used by the class
<code>ConnectionBuilder</code> that takes the two ports and the connector and
performs the connection <i>per se</i>.
</p>
<p>
Data connectors are used to connect client and server components that exchanges
data through data interfaces.  As data interfaces may use standard pull and
push interfaces, a full implementation of a standard connector can be given.
The is the role of the class <code>DataConnector</code>.
</p>
<p>
Two-way connectors and data two-way connectors are similar to connectors and
data connectors respectively, but for two-way interfaces.  Hence, a two-way
connector must be implemented as a subclass of the class
<code>AbstractTwoWayConnector</code> that will implement the user defined
two-way interface, while for data two-way connectors, a standard implementation
can be provided if the standard data two-way push and pull interfaces are used.
This is the role of the class <code>DataTwoWayConnector</code>.
</p>

<p>Usage</p>

<p>
Connectors are instantiated from standard connector classes of user-defined
and then connection is dynamically performed by calling the method
<code>connectWith</code> from the class <code>ConnectionBuilder</code> for which
a singleton object is created and stored in the static variable
<code>ConnectionBuilder.SINGLETON</code>.  The <code>connectWith</code> method
takes three arguments : the inbound port (server-side), the outbound port
(client-side) and the connector.  Hidden in the method code is the logic that
takes care of the different kinds of connection, e.g. local connection in the
same virtual machine if the two components are co-located, or a RMI connection
if the two components reside in different JVM.  Hence, it provides the
location-transparency to the connection logic.  A method
<code>disconnectWith</code> allows to properly disconnect previously connected
components.
