# A deployment uses:
# - one RMI registry per host (limitation of the RMI registry provided by
#   Oracle that entries may be set only on a registry that runs on the same
#   host),
# - one JVM running the global registry that is mapping port URIs to the host
#   on which RMI registry it is published,
# - one JVM running a  distributed cyclic barrier used to synchronise the
#   deployment processes among the different JVM running components
# - at least one, but more pragmatically more than two JVM running components
#   which are given a URI (this URI is used in the deployment code to know
#   which components must be created by the current JVM and which are created
#   by other virtual machines.
# The configuration file provides application-wide inforamtions required on
# each virtual machine to make the system work properly.
