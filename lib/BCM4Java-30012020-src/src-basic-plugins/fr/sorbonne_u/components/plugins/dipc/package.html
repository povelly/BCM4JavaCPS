The package <code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.plugins.dipc</code> provides
as a plug-in a software pattern to control the regular exchanges of
data in push mode via <code>DataOfferedI</code> and
<code>DataRequiredI</code>
interfaces.
</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>
The general idea of the plug-in is to add to the standard data
interfaces the capability for a client component to control at
which rate the server will push data towards it. The client
component is assumed to receive data from the server component
through the latter data inbound port and its data outbound port
in push mode. The two ports are also assumed to be created and
published by the two components and then connected. The plug-in
allows a client component to control the pushes from the server
by starting a series of pushes that can be unlimited in number
but stopped explicitly by the client, or for a limited predefined
number of pushes and then the server stops when this number has
been reached.
</p>
<p>
The push control services are declared by the interface
<code>PushControlI</code>, which is both a required and an offered
component interface. The server-side and client-side plug-ins are
responsible for the addition of this interface as required for
the client component and as offered for the server. They also
create the push control inbound and outbound ports and connect
them.
</p>

<p>Protocol</p>

<p>
The client is the one that requires the <code>PushControlI</code>
interface, while the server is the component that offers it. The next
sequence diagram illustrates the most important exchanges between the
two component sand their respective plug-ins when the client requires
an unlimited number of pushes that are then explicitly stopped.
