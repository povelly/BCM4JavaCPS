/**
 * The interface <code>PushControlImplementationI</code> declares basic
 * component services to control the regular exchanges of data via a
 * <code>DataOfferedI</code> interface in push mode.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * The interface defines the services to start and stop the pushing
 * of data. The two start methods allow either to perform a fixed or
 * an unbounded number of pushes with a specified interval of time
 * between each. The stop service stops the pushes that were previously
 * started. If an unbounded number of pushes have been started, the stop
 * service is the only way to stop them, but stop can also be used to
 * stop a fixed number of pushes before the end.
 *
