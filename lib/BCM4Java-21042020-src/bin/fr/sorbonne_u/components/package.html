The package <code>fr.sorbonne_u.components</code> provides a basic
component model. This model is constructed around the common
following concepts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>components, that can act both as clients when they call other
  components, or providers, when they answer calls coming from other
  components;</li>
<li>required interfaces, that express the services that a client
  component needs to call;</li>
<li>offered interfaces, that express the services that a component
  offers to other components to be called;</li>
<li>two-way interfaces, that express the services that components offer
  and require from each others in a peer-to-peer way;</li>
<li>ports, that expose under an URI individual required or offered
  interfaces of each component; an inbound port exposes an offered
  interface while an outbound port is defined by a required
  interface;</li>
<li>connectors, that allow to connect an inbound port of a provider
  component with an outbound port of a client component;</li>
<li>components, that have required and offered interfaces exposed
  through ports and that can be passive when their services are
  executed by the thread of a client component or active when they use
  their own threads to service requests or execute tasks of their
  own;</li>
<li>component virtual machines, that create components and interconnect
  them using connectors to build applications and that can be either
  local to a virtual machine or distributed among several ones;
  and,</li>
<li>a global registry, used to publish the ports under their URI, and
  therefore makes it possible to find components through their ports
  and connect to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The next figure shows how these artifacts correspond to UML entities and
artifacts in component diagrams.  As the dashed arrows show, the normal
flow of control is for the client component to call a service offered by
a provider component.  The model also offers data connections, where
the client and the provider exchanges information rather than call each
other services.  In data connections, the provider provides data that is
consumed by the client.  Data connections can be of two modes: pull or
push. In the pull mode, the client takes the initiative of requiring a
new datum from the provider, which responds by providing such a new
datum.  In push mode, the provider is taking the initiative to send a
new datum to the client whenever it wants.  Two way data connection can
also be set up, where both exchange roles as provider and client, and
can adopt either the pull or push modes.
</p>

<p>
Components can be created recursively, as part-whole hierarchies of
components where subcomponents are embedded in an aggregate component.
Unless explicitly promoted to the ports of the aggregate component, the
ports of subcomponents are not visible from the outside.  Hence, the
distinction between an assembly and an aggregate component is that the
assembly is not a component and all of the components in the assembly
are visible.  Assemblies can reside within a single JVM or multiple
ones.

<p>
The package has subpackages defining each of these concepts:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components</code> itself defines the component and
  active components;</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.cvm</code> defines the local and
  distributed component virtual machines.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.connectors</code> defines the different
  types of connectors;</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.interfaces</code> defines the component
  generic required and offered interfaces;</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.ports</code> defines the different types
  of ports.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Component required and offered interfaces are defined as Java interfaces
that extends the seminal <code>RequiredI</code> and <code>OfferedI</code>
Java interfaces.  Hence, a required interface is just a Java interface
with the signature of services, that is tagged by the fact that it
extends directly or indirectly either <code>RequiredI</code> or
<code>OfferedI</code>.
</p>

<p>
For a better support to end users, in addition to component interfaces
requiring or offering services (in terms of methods that can be called),
the package also provides for data component interfaces, that are
specific kinds of interface meant to be used to exchange data between
components rather than calling each others services.
