The package <code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.plugins.dconnection</code>
defines and implements a component dynamic connection pattern.
</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>
The component model uses ports and connectors to connect components.
In static architectures, connections that need to be done are known
at initialisation time. However, in dynamic architectures, connections
can appear and disappear during the execution.  Such dynamic
architectures are especially needed when components also appear during
execution and when the number of connections vary over time.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to do dynamic connections between components and their
ports is from the concerned components to use the methods
<code>doPortConnection</code> and <code>doPortDisconnection</code> of
the <code>ComponentI</code> interface implemented by
<code>AbstractComponent</code>. These methods require to know the URI
of the ports to be connected. If they are not known, the reflection
interface <code>ReflectionI</code> allows to query components for
these. As this makes the code grow in complexity, the dynamic
connection plug-in proposes an alternative to cope with complex
dynamic architectures. Moreover, the reflection interface
do not allow to request the creation of an inbound port in the server
side component; it can only retrieve the URI of an already created
port. This plug-in allows the server side component to create inbound
ports on demand.
</p>
<p><i>The pattern entities</i></p>
<p>
The pattern uses two sets of interfaces/ports/connector:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a static interface/port/connector which ensures the dynamic
  connection service through offered and required interfaces as
  well as their ports that are created at installation time;</li>
<li>a dynamic interfaces/ports/connectors which represent the
  actual dynamic connections that the component can handle.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When a client component wants to dynamically perform connections with
a client component, it must first install the client side plug-in. If
the client component did not install the server side plug-in yet, the
client side component can use the plug-in facility to make the server
component install it. When the two plug-ins have been installed, the
client side component can connect$ its plug-in with the one of the
server side using the plug-in method <code>connectWithServerSide</code>.
The first requires that the client side component be connected to the
server side component through the <code>ReflectionI</code> interface
to be able to call the server side to get the URI of its dynamic
connection service inbound port. With this URI, the client side
component plug-in creates the client side outbound port and connect it
to the server side inbound port.
</p>
<p>
After the connection, the two components have their respective
plug-in instances and are connected in the way illustrated by the
following UML-like class/component diagram:
</p>
<img SRC="../../../../../../images/DynamicConnectionClassDiagram.png"
     height="353" width="701"/>

<p><i>Using the pattern</i></p>
<p>
To perform the dynamic connection <i>per se</i>, the client side calls
its plug-in method <code>doDynamicConnection</code>. This methods takes
an interface that is used to get from the server side the URI of an
inbound port implementing this interface. The the client side plug-in
creates the corresponding outbound port and connect it to the provided
inbound port. After this, the dynamic connection becomes operational.
If the client side do not need to perform other dynamic connection with
the same server side component, it can disconnect its dynamic connection
service outbound port by calling the plug-in method
<code>disconnectFromServerSide</code>. It can also disconnect its
reflection outbound port from the server side reflection inbound port.
Hence, the server side may continuously offers the dynamic connection
service, but the client side connects to it only for the time required
to set up a dynamic connection.  Indeed, this pattern is meant to cater
for an unlimited number of dynamic connection accessible through a
permanent and open dynamic connection service offered by the server.
</p>
<p>
<i>Note:</i> the terms client and server in the above description refer
to the respective roles of the component that initiates the dynamic
connection and the component that waits for such requests.  The dynamic
connection built through this pattern need not be a client/server one,
but can also be a data connection or a two way connection.
</p>
<p>Protocol</p>
<p>
The client is the one that requires the
<code>DynamicConnectionRequestI</code> interface, while the server is
the component that offers it.

The abstract class <code>DynamicConnectionServerSidePlugin</code>
defines the methods and data needed to implement the client side
of the protocol while the class
<code>DynamicConnectionServerSidePlugin</code> implements the ones
needed on the server side. To use the protocol, programmers have to
define a concrete subclass of this latter abstract class, and provide
an implementation for method <code>createServerSideDynamicPort</code>.
