/**
 * The interface <code>OutBoundPortI</code> represents the category of
 * <code>PortI</code> that cater for outgoing calls from a component
 * towards its service providers.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * An outbound port is a component port through which a client component
 * calls a service provider.  It is therefore associated with a required
 * interface that represents the services that are needed by the clients
 * but that it also implements so that its owner component can call its
 * client through the outbound port.

 * invariant		this.connected() implies
