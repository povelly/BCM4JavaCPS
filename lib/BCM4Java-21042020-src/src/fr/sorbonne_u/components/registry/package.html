The RMI registry implementation coming in open implementation of Java
typically forbids the modification of an entry done from a remote host.
Hence, storing entries must be done on the same host as where the
request is made.  To circumvent this limitation, each host is running
its own copy of the RMI registry, and publication is done locally to
the host.  But then, one need to know on which host to send a RMI
request when trying to connect to a remote object.  The class
<code>GlobalRegistry</code> implements a simple central registry where
to store the information about the host running the RMI registry on
which some object has been published.  The class 
<code>GlobalRegistryClient</code> implements the client side of the
registry, a singleton of which must exist in each of the JVM where
requests must be sent to this global registry.
