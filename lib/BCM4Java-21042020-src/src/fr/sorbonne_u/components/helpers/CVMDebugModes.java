/**
 * The enumeration <code>CVMDebugModes</code> defines the different debug
 * modes that can be set on a BCM virtual machine to trigger traces on
 * the corresponding processes in the execution of a program (publishing
 * ports, calling methods across ports and connectors, etc.).
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * BCM provides a trace and logging mechanism to help debug programs. Indeed,
 * as threaded and distributed programs, BCM component-based applications are
 * difficult top debug. Java debuggers rarely handle correctly thread
 * interruptions, so putting breakpoints to inspect the state of the program
 * do not work.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class <code>AbstractComponent</code> describes the component tracing and
 * logging facility. The main method is logMessage which allows to put in the
 * code logging instructions to get values of variables (state of the program)
 * at important points in the control flow. To avoid putting and removing such
 * instructions when going from debugging to testing and then to production,
 * it is possible to put them in if statements according to debugging modes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>CVMDebugModes</code> enumeration defines the core debug modes
 * used in the BCM kernel. Adding a debug mode into the set
 * <code>AbstractCVM.DEBUG_MODES</code> enables the logging associated to
 * the corresponding mode. The set <code>AbstractCVM.DEBUG_MODES</code>
 * types its content with the interface <code>CVMDebugModesI</code> so
 * that users can extend the debugging modes with its own ones.
