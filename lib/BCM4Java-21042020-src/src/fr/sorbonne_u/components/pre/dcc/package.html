This package introduces predefined components <code>DynamicComponentCreator</code>
automatically added to each instance of assemblies to provide for a dynamic
and remote component creation service.  The basic idea is that each instance
of the assembly on each virtual machine has a copy of such a component that
offers the interface <code>DynamicComponentCreationI</code>.  The URI of the
inbound port through which the service is offered is created from the URI of
the JVM suffixed by "-dcc".  A component that want to create another component
on a remote JVM has to create an outbound port
<code>DynamicComponentCreationOutboundPort</code>, connect it to the inbound
port of the dynamic component creator running on the remote virtual machine,
and call the service <code>createComponent</code> with the appropriate
parameters.
</p>

<p>
A complementary service is provided by the package: tha capability to make
a component execute an connection with another component.  As the connection
logic offered by the <code>ConnectionBuilder</code> assumes that the connection
is made by a component local to the virtual machine where the
<code>ConnectionBuilder</code> code is executed with another component that
can be remote, a third party component asking for the creation of a component
on a remote JVM cannot itself connect this component to another one.  Hence,
a <code>DynamicallyConnectableComponentI</code> interface defines the necessary
service to be called on a component <code>C</code> to connect a port of
<code>C</code> to a port of another component.
