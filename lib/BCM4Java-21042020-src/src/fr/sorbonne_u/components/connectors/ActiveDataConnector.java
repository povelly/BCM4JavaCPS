/**
 * The class <code>ActiveBasicDataConnector</code> partially implements an
 * active connector that can be used to connect qctive components in a
 * synchronised way, on a mix of active and passive components using a full or
 * partial pull mode.
 *
 * TODO: needs rethinking and redesign so to be used only when the two
 *       components use different push/pull mode so to connect them
 *       transparently.
 * 
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * As there are two possible mode for transmitting data, push and pull, the
 * connector establishes a two way connection between the two components,
 * implementing the offering <code>PushI</code> interface with methods calling
 * the requiring <code>PushI</code> and implementing the requiring
 * <code>PullI</code> interface with methods calling the offering
 * <code>PullI</code> one.
 * 
 * A fully active connector has two threads: one to actively push data to
 * the requiring component by calling its <code>receive</code> method, and
 * one to actively pull data from the offering component by calling its
 * <code>get</code> method.
 * 
 * The connector acts as a bounded buffer between the two components.  If
 * the requiring component actively pull data from the connector, then the
 * connector can be configured as a passive pusher, while if the offering
 * component actively pushes data to the connector, then it can be configured
 * as a passive puller.
 * 
 * When the connector is configured as a passive pusher, then its implementation
 * of the <code>request</code> method can be used by the requiring component
 * to obtain new datum by accessing directly and synchronisely the buffer.
 * In the same way, when the connector is configured as a passive puller, then
 * its implementation of the <code>send</code> method can be used by the
 * offering component to push new datum by putting them into the buffer
 * in a synchronized way.
