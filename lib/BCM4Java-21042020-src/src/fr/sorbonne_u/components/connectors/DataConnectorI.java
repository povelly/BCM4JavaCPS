/**
 * The interface <code>BasicDataConnectorI</code> is the generic interface for
 * connectors that mediate between requiring and offering components that
 * exchange data rather than calling services from each others.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The interfaces <code>DataRequiredI.PullI</code> and
 * <code>DataOfferedI.PushI</code> contains methods that have different
 * signatures, so that the connector know which way the calls are going.
 * If extensions want to have part of their methods with the same
 * signature, techniques similar to the ones used in data two
 * way interfaces will be required to implement the connector.
 * If teh two interfaces need to be the same then data two way
 * interfaces and connectors should be used instead.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When components exchange data rather than calling services from each
 * others, the offering component is considered as the producer of data
 * while the requiring one is considered as the consumer. And the two
 * interfaces are assumed to be developed independently, the data
 * interfaces in the required and the offered interfaces need not be the
 * same (not declare methods with the same signature). The connector is
 * therefore responsible for the implementation of translating methods
 * <code>to</code> and <code>from</code>.
