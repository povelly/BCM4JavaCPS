/**
 * The interface <code>TwoWayDataI</code> enables two components to exchange
 * data in a peer-to-peer way, that is the two components implement the same
 * interface and have both the sender and receiver roles.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * The interface defines the type of data it will allow to exchange and two
 * methods <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>.  Components use the
 * <code>send</code> method to send a piece of data to the other component,
 * while they implement the <code>receive</code> to accept a piece of data
 * from the other component.  The connector implements the <code>send</code>
 * method in such a way to call the <code>receive</code> of the other component
 * to pass the data to it.
 * 
 * Contrary to the data exchange offered and required interfaces, that assume
 * that one component has the sender role and the other the receiver one, in
 * this case, the two have both roles, so they can send and receive data.
 * Hence, for the connector to be able to distinguish between the sender and
 * the receiver, the <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> methods are
 * called through a proxy when going to the other component, as with two way
 * ports.
