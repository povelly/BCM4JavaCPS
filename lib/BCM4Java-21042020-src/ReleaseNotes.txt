This release presents some important modifications:

- The series of methods in AbstractComponent which submit requests and tasks
  to the component have been modified to explicit the exact exceptions that
  they throw to facilitate the exception handling in the calling code.

- The series of methods handleRequestAsync has been eliminated to clarify the
  role of the different requests/tasks submission methods. Now, all methods
  referring to requests are synchronous and all methods referring to tasks are
  asynchronous.

- The series of methods in AbstractComponent which submit requests and tasks
  to the component has also been clarified to have on one side internal
  (protected) methods that return futures, which can be used inside components
  to run requests and tasks asynchronously and synchronise on these futures,
  and external (public) methods that do not return futures because BCM does not
  have futures for RMI call yet.

- In AbstractComponent, the creation of pool of threads have been modified to
  use executor service factories, which allows programmers to create customised
  pools.
