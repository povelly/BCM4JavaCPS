The package <code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.interfaces</code> contains
all of the kind of interfaces a component can use and implement.  The
interface <code>ComponentI</code> serves as a common supertype for all
interfaces in the component model.  A component interface is associated
with a <i>port</i> on a component, through which the component will be
connected to another component using a <i>connector</i>.  Two major
kinds of interface are then introduced:
</p>
<ol>
<li><code>OfferedI</code> is an interface implemented by a component acting as
  a service provider. An offered interface therefor declares the signature
  of services (methods) provided by the component.</li>
<li><code>RequiredI</code> is an interface that is required by a component,
  expressing the services that the component will require during its
  execution.</li>
</ol>
<p>
When connecting components, a required interface of one component will be
matched with the offered interface of another component in order to connect
them, either as subcomponents of a composite components or inside an assembly
of components.  Offered interfazces can lead to several connections to several
client compoents, but required interfaces are connected 
</p>

<p><b>Data exchange interfaces</b></p>

<p>
Many components just exchange data, and not services <i>per se</i>.  To cater
for asynchronous exchange of data, two variant interfaces are defined:
</p>
<ol>
<li><code>DataOfferedI</code> is an interface implemented by a component that
  will produce data.</li>
<li><code>DataRequiredI</code> is an interface implemented by a component that
  will consume data.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Both <code>DataOfferedI</code> and <code>DataRequiredI</code> declares a
<code>DataI</code> internal interface that serves as a supertype for objects
implementing the data that is exchanged between a producer and a consumer.
The classes defining data objects need not be implementing both the
<code>DataOfferedI.DataI</code> and <code>DataRequiredI.DataI</code>.
Indeed, though it is the most simple way to make the object directly
interpretable on both sides, data connectors propose an alternative way
to mediate between producer and consumer of data by requiring the implementation
of conversion <code>to</code> and <code>from</code> that allows to converts
required side data objects <i>to</i> offered side ones, and required side
objects <i>from</i> offered side ones.
</p>
<p>
Data exchange interfaces can be used in two modes: pull and push.  In pull
mode, the consumer components calls the producer whenever it needs another
piece of data.  In push mode, the producer calls to consumer each time it
has a new piece of data that can be consumed.  These two modes are taken
into account by two internal interfaces <code>PullI</code> and
<code>PushI</code> defined in both <code>DataOfferedI</code> and
<code>DataRequiredI</code> interfaces.  The pull mode is implemented
by the pair of methods defined in the <code>PullI</code> interfaces:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>get()</code> method in the <code>DataOfferedI.PullI</code>
  interface, that is called upon the producer to get the next piece of
  data.</li>
<li>the <code>request()</code> method in the <code>DataRequiredI.PullI</code>
  interface, that is called upon the producer to request the next piece of
  data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Similarly, the push mode is implemented by the pair of methods defined in the
<code>PushI</code> interfaces:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>send(DataI)</code> method in the <code>DataOfferedI.PushI</code>
  interface, that is called by the producer to send the next piece of
  data.</li>
<li>the <code>receive(DataI)</code> method in the
  <code>DataRequiredI.PushI</code> interface, that is called upon the consumer 
  to pass it the next piece of data.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Two way interfaces</b></p>

<p>
A third kind of interface is added: <code>TwoWayI</code> that is used when
two components play symmetrically the role of requirer and offerer of services
to each other, for example in peer-to-peer algorithms.  Indeed, it is much
simpler in this case to consider that the two components as implementing a
unique interface rather that trying to connect them through two pairs of
required and offered interfaces.  It also simplifies the connector that will
bind the two.  As in offered and required interfaces, a data exchange variant
of the two interfaces is defined: <code>DataTwoWayI</code>.  In two-way data
exchange, there is no need to distinguish a push and a pull mode, as both
components may take the initiative os sending a piece of data to the other
component.  Exchanges are thus using only one pair of methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>send(DataI, DataTwoWayPortI)</code> method that is called by the
  sender to send the next piece of data.</li>
<li>the <code>receive(DataI, DataTwoWayPortI)</code> method that is called upon
  the receiver to pass it the next piece of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These two methods take as parameter the port of the sender to enable the
connector to forward the piece of data in the right direction.  Indeed, as
both components can act as sender and receiver, this parameter identifies
the sender (and therefore the receiver) in the current exchange.
</p>

<p><b>Using the package</b></p>

<p>
When programming components, interfaces of the components must be defined to
expose the services offered by the components and to make explicit the services
required by the component.  For each interface, the programmer must select the
appropriate type of interfaces that is needed and make the corresponding
interface defined in this package the super interface of its interface.
