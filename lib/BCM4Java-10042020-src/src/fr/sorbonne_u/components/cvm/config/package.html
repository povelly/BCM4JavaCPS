This package defines what is required to parse configuration files (class
<code>ConfigurationFileParser</code>) and store the configuration parameters
(class <code>ConfigurationParameters</code>).  The Relax NG schema for the
configuration files is: 
</p>

<pre>
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A deployment uses:
# - one RMI registry per host (limitation of the RMI registry provided by
#   Oracle that entries may be set only on a registry that runs on the same
#   host),
# - one JVM running the global registry that is mapping port URIs to the host
#   on which RMI registry it is published,
# - one JVM running a  distributed cyclic barrier used to synchronise the
#   deployment processes among the different JVM running components
# - at least one, but more pragmatically more than two JVM running components
#   which are given a URI (this URI is used in the deployment code to know
#   which components must be created by the current JVM and which are created
#   by other virtual machines.
# The configuration file provides application-wide inforamtions required on
# each virtual machine to make the system work properly.
