<p>
In this example, a basic client/server is constructed.  Upon a call, the server
will provide a string that is an URI.
</p>

<p>Here are the steps from the design to execution:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first step is to define the <b>interfaces</b> of the components.  In
  this example, the offered interface is <code>URIProviderI</code>, which
  defines a method <code>proideURI</code>.  Notice that this method throws an
  exception, as it is required from the RMI protocol that all methods
  that can be called through RMI throws at least the
  <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code>.  The required interface is
  <code>URIConsumerI</code>.  As in component-based programming, client and
  server components need not be designed by the same persons, and may be
  connected after their design and implementation, the required interface does
  not necessarily use the same signatures for the service.  A method in a
  required interface does not have to throw an exception, but here as the
  service method does, we add the exception throwing declaration to be able
  to propagate the exception if necessary.
</li>
<li>The second step is beginning to define the components, starting with the
  server component in order to know what will be the service methods.  The
  component is a subclass of <code>AbstractComponent</code> called
  <code>URIProvider</code>, to which we add a method
  <code>provideURIService</code>.
</li>
<li>The third step is to define the inbound port to expose the offered interface
  of the component.  The port is created as a subclass of
  <code>AbstractInboundPort</code> named <code>URIProviderInboundPort</code>.
  See the documentation of this class for details about the port design and
  implementation.
  </li>
<li>The fourth step is now to come back to the server component and complete
  its creation so that it creates and publish its inbound port.  To do so,
  a constructor must be provided to <codeURIProvider</code>, taling as basis
  the constructors of the class <code>AbstractComponent</code>.  Here, we want
  an active component with one thread, so we use the constructor
  <code>AbstractComponent(boolean)</code> as a basis.  Beware that component
  interfaces must be added to the appropriate sets, ports must be put into
  the set of ports of the component and published appropriately when needed.
</li>
<li>The fifth step is to implement the outbound port that will be used by the
  client component.  The port is a subclass of <code>AbstractOutboundPort</code>
  called <code>URIGetterOutboundPort</code>.  As other outbound port, it
  implements the required interface to make it possible for the owner component
  to call it, and upon such a call, it transfers it to the connector, that will
  itself call the inbound port of the server component.
</li>
<li>The sixth step is to define and implement the client component.  In this
  short example, the client component will play the active role, calling the
  service ten times and printing the returned URI.  Tasks are created as
  implementations of the interface <code>ComponentTask</code> defined in the
  interface <code>ComponentI</code>.  It only requires to define a run method,
  which in this case calls an internal method <code>getURIandPrint</code>
  that implements the component's behaviour.
</li>
<li>The seventh step is to implement the connector, a simple client server
  connector subclass of <code>AbstractConnector</code> called
  <code>URIServiceConnector</code>.  This connector implements the required
  interface by simply calling the inbound port with the corresponding offered
  method.
</li>
<li>The eight step is to define the assembly, but then you must choose
  between a local execution within one JVM, or a distributed one over several
  JVM.  The steps differ, so they are explained separately for the two cases.
</li>
<li>The ninth step is execution, but again it differs whether the execution is
  using one or several JVM, so the steps are explained separately for the two
  cases.
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>The single JVM case</b></p>

<p>
In the single JVM case, an assembly is created by a component virtual machine
itself as a subclass of <code>AbstractCVM</code>, called <code>CVM</code>.
This CVM deploys two components: a provider and a consumer.  The two are
connected by their inbound and outbound ports respectively, through the connector.
To connect two ports, it is necessary that to know the URI of the two ports
to be connected.  For simplicity, <code>CVM</code> defines them as static
constants.
</p>
<p>
Next, the method <code>deploy</code> must be implemented to create the
components, publish their ports and connect them.  Notice here that the
provider component is created by passing the constant false to the constructor
of <code>URIProvider</code>, hence its inbound port will be published only
locally, as single JVM deployment do not use a global and RMI registry.
A connector is instantiated from <code>URIServiceConnector</code> and used
to connect the two components by calling the method <code>connectWith</code> on
<code>ConnectionBuilder.SINGLETON</code>.
</p>
<p>
The main method of the CVM creates an instance of <code>CVM</code>, calls its
method <code>startStandardLifeCycle</code>, waits until the program has finished,
and then exits with <code>System.exit(0)</code>.  The class <code>CVM</code> can
the be run as any Java application, as it appears in this first screen shot before
starting the execution where the source are placed in the subdirectory
<code>jars</code>:
</p>

<img SRC="../../../../../../images/before-execution.jpg"/>

<p>
During the execution, the consumer prints a new URI each 2 seconds:
</p>

<img SRC="../../../../../../images/during-execution.jpg"/>

<p>
At the end of the execution, the ten URI have been printed and the control
returns to the shell.
</p>

<img SRC="../../../../../../images/after-execution.jpg"/>

<p><b>The multiple JVM case</b></p>

<p>
In the multiple JVM case, a distributed assembly is created by a distributed
CVM itself defined as a subclass of <code>AbstractDistributedCVM</code>, called
<code>DistributedCVM</code>.  But before going into the code of this class, the
programmer must decide a deployment and its configuration.  A distributed CVM
will be run on several JVM, and eventually on several hosts.  Connecting
components running on different JVM uses RMI, which requires the publication of
remote objects (here component ports) on a RMI registry, and in the openly
available implementations of Java, a RMI registry cannot be changed by code
running on a different host, so one need to have one RMI registry running per
host.  All of these requirements force every part of the distributed CVM to have
informations about the registry and the registry needs to know about the number
of JVM implied in an execution.  A configuration file in XML is used to provide
this information, and such configuration files obey a Relax NG schema provided
with the component model implementation.  In our client server example, it
looks like follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;deployment&gt;
   &lt;hosts&gt;
    &lt;host name="localhost" dir="path-to-execution-dir/"/&gt;
  &lt;/hosts&gt;
  &lt;cyclicBarrier   hostname="localhost" port="55253"/&gt;
  &lt;globalRegistry  hostname="localhost" port="55252"/&gt;
  &lt;rmiRegistryPort no="55999"/&gt;
  &lt;jvms2hostnames&gt;
    &lt;jvm2hostname jvmuri="provider"
        rmiRegistryCreator="true"
        hostname="localhost"
        mainclass="fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.basic_cs.DistributedCVM"/&gt;
    &lt;jvm2hostname jvmuri="consumer"
        rmiRegistryCreator="false"
        hostname="localhost"
        mainclass="fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.basic_cs.DistributedCVM"/&gt;
  &lt;/jvms2hostnames&gt;
&lt;/deployment&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This distributed CVM deploys the two components, a provider and a
consumer, in two distinct JVM called <code>provider</code> and
<code>consumer</code>.  The two JVM are run on the same host,
<code>localhost</code>.  As we need to have on RMI registry per host,
one and only one JVM per host must be declared as the RMI registry
creator, the other will use the same registry.  The first seven lines
provide information about the central resources: the hosts used to run
the application with for each the execution directory, the host running
the assembly cyclic barrier and the port on which it listens, the host
running the global registry and the port on which it listens, and the
port used by the different RMI registry.
</p>
<p>
The code of <code>DistributedCVM</code> uses the names of the JVM to
know where to statically create the components and where to perform
the connections and disconnections of the components.  The
<code>deploy</code> method is now decomposed into three methods,
<code>initialise</code>, <code>instantiateAndPublish</code> and
<code>interconnect</code>, and the different DCVM sites synchronise
with each other at each step. <code>initialise</code> can be used to
do anything required before the creation of components, and in the base
class it creates and initialises the references to the RMI registry. 
<code>instantiateAndPublish</code> creates each component on the right
JVM and publishes their ports. <code>interconnect</code> creates the
connectors and performs the connections but in only one JVM for each
connection, the one of one of the two connected components.  The method
<code>main</code> creates an instance of <code>DistributedCVM</code>,
calls calls he method <code>startStandardLifeCycle</code> with an
execution duration of 15 seconds for the consumer component to complete
its execution, and then exits.
</p>

<p>
Note also that the code need to have access to the schema of the
configuration file, <code>deployment.rnc</code>, put in a subdirectory
<code>config</code>. It also needs to have access to jars of the code:
the basic component model, the code of the component model, e.g.
<code>BasicComponentModel.jar</code>, the component-based application
(here, the basic client/server example is already in the
<code>BCM.jar</code> archive), as well as the <code>jing.jar</code>
library used to validate the <code>config.xml</code> file against the
<code>deployment.rnc</code> Relax NG schema.  Launching shell
scripts below assume that all java archives are in a subdirectory
<code>jars</code>.
</p>

<p>
To execute the application, two JVM must be started to execute the
global registry and the DCVM cyclic barrier, and two others to run
the components. There are two ways to do that: a fully manual and a
semi-automatic. For the manual one, three shell scripts are provided
to ease the process, the script <code>start-gregistry</code>:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
java -cp &apos;jars/*&apos; -Djava.security.manager \
     -Djava.security.policy=dcvm.policy \
     fr.sorbonne_u.components.registry.GlobalRegistry config.xml
</pre>

<p>
the script <code>start-cyclicbarrier</code>:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
java -cp 'jars/*' -Djava.security.manager \
     -Djava.security.policy=dcvm.policy \
     fr.sorbonne_u.components.cvm.utils.DCVMCyclicBarrier config.xml
</pre>

<p>
and the script <code>start-dcvm</code>:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$1" ]; then 
  echo usage: $0 jvmName
  exit
 fi
java -ea -cp 'jars/*' -Djava.security.manager \
     -Djava.security.policy=dcvm.policy \
     fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.basic_cs.DistributedCVM $1 config.xml
</pre>
<p>
that requires adaptation for each application and which receives as
command line parameter the name of the JVM it executes in the DCVM
deployment. Note that this is the main class provided in the
<code>config.xml</code> file.
</p>

<p>
Notice the use of a security manager to give the application the
necessary rights to access the files and use sockets, etc.  The
BCM standard policy file used in this application is:
</p>
<pre>
grant {
  permission java.io.FilePermission "./*", "write";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "./jars/*", "read,write";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_31.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/*", "read";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_31.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/*", "read";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_31.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/*", "read";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessDeclaredMembers" ;
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "getClassLoader" ;
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory:http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0", "read,write";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "./config/deployment.rnc", "read";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "./config.xml", "read";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "./*", "write";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "<<ALL FILES>>", "execute";
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.dir", "read";
  permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:1999", "connect, resolve";
  permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:1024-", "connect, resolve";
  permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:1024-", "accept, resolve";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "stopThread";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "modifyThread";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "modifyThreadGroup";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "setIO";
};
</pre>

<p>
The next screen shot shows four shell windows with the four command ready to
be executed:
</p>
<img SRC="../../../../../../images/before-distributed-execution.jpg"/>

<p>
Similarly to the single JVM case, during the execution, the progress of the
consumer can be seen in its window:
</p>
<img SRC="../../../../../../images/during-distributed-execution.jpg"/>

<p>
And at the end, the list of produced URI is completed, and all of the processes
have stopped and returned to the shell:
</p>
<img SRC="../../../../../../images/after-distributed-execution.jpg"/>

<p>
The manual way can be used either for an execution on a single host
or on several hosts where the user needs to connect to execute the
scripts.
</p>
<p>
The semi-automatic way to execute the application can only execute
applications on a single host at this time. It uses the class
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.cvm.utils.DCVM_Launcher</code>, which
is simply executed as a main Java class provided with the name of the
<code>config.xml</code> file as a command line parameter.
