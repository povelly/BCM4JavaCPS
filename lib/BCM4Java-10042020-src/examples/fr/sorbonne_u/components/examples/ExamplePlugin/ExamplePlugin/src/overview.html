This package and its subpackages present an example of BCM plug-ins used to
implement a hash map component <i>i.e.</i>, a component that offers the
services of a hash map. The Java interface <code>MapImplementationI</code>
declares the signatures of the services that pertain to a hash map as is used
as an implementation interface. The component interface <code>MapI</code>, both
offered and required, turns this implementation interface into a component
one (in the sense of BCM). As uaual, ports and connector are implemented for
this component interface.
</p>
<p>
The packages <code>fr.sorbonne_u.cps.map.interfaces</code>,
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.cps.map.components</code>,
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.cps.map.deployments</code>,
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.cps.map.connectors</code> and
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.cps.map.ports</code> proposes a standard implementation
for the hash map component. The package
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.cps.map.withplugin</code> and its subpackages modify the
implementation of the hash map to use plug-ins.
