The continuation-passing style has been essentially used in
functional programming both to better understand control-flow
principles supporting phenomena like recursion and tail-recursion
as well as to provide continuations as first class citizen in
a programs. The most concrete place where to learn about the
continuation-passing style is the programming language Scheme
with its call-with-current-continuation function.
</p>

<p>
This BCM example shows how ideas from the continuation-passing
style can appear in its component programming model. Two main forms
of continuation-passing style are of common use in BCM programming:
<ol>
<li>the <i>explicit result notification</i> idiom and</li>
<li>the <i>continuation upon future result</i> idiom.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Explicit result notification</b></p>

<p>
<i>To be written.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Continuation upon future result</b></p>

<p>
The component interface <code>ValueProvidingI</code> defines a
service to provide integer values. A component
<code>RandomValueProvider</code> is implemented to expose this
service and implement it by returning random int value.
The consumer is implemented in the component class
<code>ValueConsumer</code>.
</p>
<p>
When the component <code>ValueConsumer</code> calls
<code>RandomValueProvider</code> the standard way, its only thread
will be blocked until it receives the request value. In some cases,
such blocking may cause troubles, for example if the caller has only
one thread (perhaps because it requires a completely serialised
execution of its services) a callback will not be possible because
the only thread is blocked for the result that the callback would
presumably lead to (hence, a deadlock, famous for callbacks).
</p>
<p>
The idea is to release the thread of the caller by putting the
remaining of the code that is waiting the value in another method,
task or simply block of code which plays the role of the continuation.
The calling service, here <code>computeAndThenPrint</code>, uses a
separate thread to perform the call to the service <code>getValue</code>
of the server component, a thread that will wait for the result and
then call the continuation with it (here
<code>computeAndThenPrintContinuation</code>). When this thread has
started, the current execution of the method
<code>computeAndThenPrint</code> must release the control over its
component thread. Thus, <code>computeAndThenPrint</code> must be
written to simply terminate and leave to the continuation method
the computation that requires the result.
